## Planning
* Imagery: The images used are vital in conveying peace and traquility witouth overshadowing the writting context of the page. The ones used in the products sections are to attract user and give them an idea of the product they will be receiving.

* Colours: Notably, the primary colour seen consitently is green colour palette. This represents health. Additional colours including black and white used, especially on text, is to create contrast.

* Fonts: `cursive, sans-serif` font used creates elegance and keeps the page from being overly uniformed and boring.

### WireFrames
Balsamiq was used in the design of the website.

The structure of the image was designed with the intention that not all of it will be implemented in the website, due to stylistic changes and determine what fits the aim of the website.

## Test and Validation
Validations were carried out and used to make necessary improvements to the code for the final product.

<details>
<summary>Lighthouse Validation</summary>
The accessibility aspect of the code was challenging. Some flaws highlighted by the Lighthouse validator and subsequently fixed by the developer included:

[Find Lighthouse errors](docs/Readmeimages/validation/lighthouse)

Lighthouse was used to evaluate the performance of the website on each page. The most troublesome page was the product page, which had multiple layout shifts. This was remedied by changing the images and restyling the HTML to minimise layout shifts, improving the performance score from 75 to 89.

**Landing Page**
* Forms ID and label mismatch
* Image loading issues: not fixed
* Contrast issues

**Product Page**
* Input label mismatch - labels not necessary
* Buttons do not have accessible names

**Thank You Page**
* No meta description

**Background Image Loading Issues on the Homepage**
* This caused a reduction in accessibility and performance. However, the other pages had better performance and accessibility.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixing and Debugging</summary>

* Lighthouse errors were fixed and tested again. Some errors, such as image loading issues, were not resolved as fixing them would break the website.

* There were no errors with CSS according to the Jigsaw validator. This can be seen [here](docs/Readmeimages/validation/jigsaw-validation). Any issues identified were fixed.

* Many of the [W3C tests](docs/Readmeimages/validation/w3chtmlvalidation) found throughout the HTML were similar, consisting mostly of bad practices and trailing slashes. These were noted and the relevant changes were made in accordance with W3C validation standards.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Errors Not Fixed</summary>

**Lighthouse Home Page**
* Background and foreground colours do not have a sufficient contrast ratio
* `<frame>` or `<iframe>` elements do not have a title
* Elements with visible text labels do not have matching accessible names.
* Image elements have `alt` attributes that are redundant text

**Lighthouse Product Page**
* Buttons do not have an accessible names
* Elements with visible text labels do not have matching accessible names
* Image elements have `alt` attributes that are redundant text
* Select elements do not have associated label elements
</details>

### Form Testing

* The developer ensured forms indicated a required alert when the user clicked on the submit button

### Links Testing
* The links were verified to ensure they sent users to the correct location

### Browser Testing
The website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers with no major issues noted, except for the display of the favicon.

### Responsiveness Testing
* [Responsive Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/checker.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjonfd4.github.io%2FdreamTeaHouseProject%2Findex.html&width=1400&height=700)
