* Colours: Notably, the primary colour seen consitently is green colour palette. This represents health. Additional colours including black and white used, especially on text, is to create contrast.

* Fonts: `cursive, sans-serif` font used creates elegance and keeps the page from being overly uniformed and boring.
## WireFrames
